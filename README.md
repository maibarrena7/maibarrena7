## 🔭 Currently working on
- PhD: *Working on spatial-temporal dynamics of coastal fish assemblages in northern Patagonia, interspecific interactions and artisanal fishery.*
- Trophic ecology research: *Trophic relationships and foodweb indicators of the coastal fish assemblage in San Antonio Bay (Río Negro).*
- Who can live in San Antonio bay survey: *Regional and functional filters as drivers of temporal persistence and turnover in the fish assemblage of San Antonio Bay, Northern Patagonia.*
- Socioeconomic and cultural research: *Trying to answer to what extent do San Antonio Bay's artisanal fishers maintain their traditional practices? Which species currently dominate their catch, and what’s driving that trend?*

 ## 🌱 Publications and collaborations
**[Thorny-headed worms of the Patagonian blennie:](https://doi.org/10.14411/fp.2025.030)** We report the fauna of the Acanthocephala of 120 Patagonian blennies Eleginops maclovinus (Cuvier) from northern Patagonia, Argentina.

**[A historical appraisal of San Antonio bay fish assemblage:](https://doi.org/10.47193/mafis.3842025011010)** This study characterizes the composition and temporal dynamics of the coastal fish assemblage and evaluates its relationship with the artisanal fishery by comparing current findings with historical records. 

**[Population dynamics of the Pacific cupped oyster Magallana gigas in northern Patagonia:](https://doi.org/10.47193/mafis.3822025010105)** This research focusses on the present M. gigas population encompassing distribution, abundance, and size structure along a 180-km coastal line from EC to San Antonio Este.


**[A Latin American network of microbial observatories for monitoring aquatic ecosystems:](https://doi.org/10.25260/EA.24.34.3.0.2436)** We aim to provide a historical overview of the network’s formation, highlighting key debates and definitions that took place during 2017-2023.


 ### 🤔 What i've been learning: 
 I am I've recently been expanding my work on reproducibility, transparency, and open science practices, developing collaborative workflows in R and Python using GitHub. I have also begun working with large-scale monitoring datasets, satellite-derived environmental data, and other high-volume ecological data sources.

I am interested in deepening this line of work by integrating complex ecological theory with empirical research, using Patagonian coastal systems as a natural laboratory. At the same time, I aim to further strengthen my skills in marine ecosystem modeling and network-based approaches to understand community structure and reorganization under anthropogenic change.

- ⚡ Fun fact: *When I started my degree in marine biology I said: "I'm never going to work with fish, they smell bad"*
